# Fashion-mnist_CNN_Image-Processing-
Application of Convolution Neural Network for an image processing task (Coursera Exercise_Andrew Ng and Laurence Moroney) 
making comparison between this repository and the previous one,with the same data-set,will give you cogent reasons for application of CNNs for image proccessing tasks.
Call back is applied in this code inorder to make the model stop the processing at expected loss and acc values.
